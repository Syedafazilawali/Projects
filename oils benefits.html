<br>

 <div class="text-dark p-3">
 <h5>
<br>
The Ancient Greeks referred to olive oil as liquid gold while celebs including Miranda Kerr have heaped praise on coconut oil (she’s said to eat four teaspoons of the stuff every day).
<br>
<br>
But did you know coconut oil can be used as a deodorant, olive oil is said to soothe a sore throat while almond oil can treat dandruff?
<br>
<br>
Find out why the oils you have in your kitchen cupboard at home might just be your new beauty BFFs with our 17 life hacks below.
<br>

<img src="images/coconut oil.PNG" width="200px" height="200px">Coconut Oil
<br>
<br>
1. Clean your teeth
<br>
Shailene Woodley and Gwyneth Paltrow are just some of the stars that are into oil pulling. Simply take a tablespoon of coconut/sesame oil and swish it around your mouth for 20 minutes before spitting out for healthy teeth and gums.
<br>
2. Repair damaged hair
<br>
Olive Oil is a cheap and easy way to repair dry or damaged hair. Take around 200ml of olive oil and massage into the lengths and ends of dry hair, leaving on for up to two hours for super glossy locks.
<br>
3. Make you feel better
<br>
Sore throat? You could try swallowing some olive oil to soothe the pain. Ear ache? Swab some olive oil on the outer part of the ear to soften the ear wax, making it easier to remove.
<br>
4. Remove your make-up
<br>
Ditch the expensive beauty products for good ol’ olive oil. Just massage it into your face and remove it with a hot cloth. It even works for stubborn mascara!
<br>
5. Face cream
<br>
Coconut oil is a multi-purpose beauty wonder product – doubling up as an eye and lip balm as well as a hydrating face cream. Just make sure not to get it in your eyes!
<br>
6. Body moisturizer
<br>
Slapping on some coconut oil just after you’ve stepped out of the shower is the perfect time to reap its full benefits - the skin is still warm and supple so the oil sinks in quicker.
<br>
7. Cuticle oil
<br>
Forget investing in a heavy-duty cuticle cream – just wash your hands and apply coconut oil to cuticles. Massage it in gently before pressing back with cuticle sticks.
<br>
8. Massage oil
<br>
Add a few drops of a relaxing, scented oil such as lavender into coconut oil before massaging onto yours or your partner’s body for a truly sensual experience. It’s also said to relieve aching joints.
<br>
9. Reduce dark circles
<br>
Almond oil is a perfect natural alternative to your typical daily eye cream. Simply gently apply it to the area around your eyes before you go to sleep and allow it to work overnight.
<br>
10. Shave your legs
<br>
We’ve all replaced shaving cream with soap or moisturizer but have you ever thought to substitute it for olive oil? It’s a great money saving trick that works just as well as the real thing.
<br>

<br>
<br>
11. Natural deodorant
<br>
Dab a small amount of coconut oil under arms as an organic replacement to traditional antiperspirants.
<br>
12. Scar treatment
<br>
Rub coconut oil over scars twice a day to reduce their appearance on your face or body.
<br>
13. Clean hands
<br>
Mix one teaspoon of olive oil with one teaspoon of salt and rub the mixture between your palms to remove dirt and grime from overworked hands.  It’s said to make them softer too.
<br>
14. Treat dandruff
<br>
Almond oil has been found to effectively cure scalp conditions including dandruff by removing dead skin cells. Apply to hair and leave on locks for 30 minutes before washing out.
<br>
15. Tackle eczema
<br>
Coconut oil has been found to reduce the impact of skin conditions including eczema. Rub it over the affected area twice a day to reduce itchiness.  
<br>
16. Beat acne
<br>
Create a homemade facial exfoliator by mixing four tablespoons of salt with three tablespoons of olive oil – the salt cleanses pores before the oil restores your skin’s natural moisture levels. Massage into your face for a few minutes before rinsing off.
<br>
17. Boost memory
<br>

Add a few drops of almond oil – a source of omega-3 fatty acids - to a glass of milk to boost memory and strengthen the nervous system.<br><br>
